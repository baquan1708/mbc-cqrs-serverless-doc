  "Unlike unit testing, which focuses on individual modules and classes, end-to-end (e2e) testing covers the interaction of classes and modules at a more aggregate level -- closer to the kind of interaction that end-users will have with the production system. As an application grows, it becomes hard to manually test the end-to-end behavior of each API endpoint. Automated end-to-end tests help us ensure that the overall behavior of the system is correct and meets project requirements.": "Unlike unit testing, which focuses on individual modules and classes, end-to-end (e2e) testing covers the interaction of classes and modules at a more aggregate level -- closer to the kind of interaction that end-users will have with the production system.
